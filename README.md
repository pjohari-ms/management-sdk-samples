# Azure Management SDK Samples for Azure Cosmos DB

This repository contains of Azure Management SDK samples for Azure Cosmos DB to create and update Azure Cosmos DB resources through it's resource provider (control plane). Azure resource providers are used to provision and manage resources in Azure. 

The samples can be used to support users who are adopting Microsoft Entra Id and disabling key-based access to their data and want to manage their Cosmos resources using an SDK rather than use Bicep templates, PowerShell or Azure CLI.

## Resource Operations

These samples demonstrate create or update operations on the following Cosmos DB resources, including:

- Accounts:
    - Serverless, IP firewall rules, and disabling local auth (key-based data plane access) to force Entra Id for Auth-N and role-based access control (RBAC) for Auth-Z
- Databases
- Containers:
    - Hierarchical partition keys, index policies, unique keys, ttl, conflict resolution policies, autoscale throughput
- Throughput
    - Update autoscale throughput
- RBAC definitions:
    - Creating a built-in definition, creating a custom RBAC definition
- RBAC assignments

The samples also include some other handy conveniences for developers working with Cosmos resources including: 

- Getting your IP address to add to a Firewall Rule, add Portal Access and Azure data center access
- Getting your principal id for RBAC assignments 

## Languages available
